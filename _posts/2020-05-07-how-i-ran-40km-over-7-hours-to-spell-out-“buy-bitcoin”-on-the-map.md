40 km and 7 hours of running and I finally did it!

Most people hate running because it feels meaningless and boring… Well, now that you’ve seen this, you don’t have an excuse! Pick something you’d like to say - something funny, or something serious - something meaningful to you; draw it out on a map and run that thing! I promise you — running won't ever feel the same.

This started as a joke on April 10, a few days after Singapore introduced a lockdown. I was going crazy in isolation and to cure my boredom an idea to run the word “HELP” somehow popped in to my mind. Once I was done running “HELP” - I thought, why stop there?! To celebrate my upcoming 30th birthday and the 2nd Bitcoin halving I decided to expand this to “HELP ME BUY 30 BITCOIN” 😂 These were my most meaningful runs ever - silly, right? Now that I’m done, I can finally rest and think of my next project.

P.S. By the time I finished running BITCOIN, it’s price went up 6% in the last hour. Perhaps if we collectively run “Bitcoin” every day, it’ll go to the moon faster?

Several people been asking me if I actually ran this and how did i get such straight lines

* Yes, I actually ran this. 40km. Maybe more.
* To get straight lines, you've got to turn on tracking only at the edges. So that Strava doesn't track every step on the path. Otherwise you'll get a messy picture like this:
