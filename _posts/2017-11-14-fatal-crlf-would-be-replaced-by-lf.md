![Pusheen Coding](https://media.giphy.com/media/AbDb2PniluFwY/giphy.gif) This is my favorite issue! ðŸ˜» Why? Because each
time this happens, i rush to Google and my [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/ksaitor) to find where I saved my
magic conversion code snippet.

- Run this twice: `git config --global core.autocrlf false`
- Do git add again

However, if you'd like to convert just one file or files one by one, then you can run this line:

```
perl -pi -e 's/\r\n/\n/g' input.file
```

Good luck coding! ðŸ¦„
