title: You dont have to reply, if you ...

Here is an actionable tip, how to get constructive feedback and resurrect customers.
A brief explanation of what I'm doing here:

- For early days, I don't have an "unsubscribe" link in my emails, instead, I write: "If you'd like to unsubscribe, please let me know by replying to this email." Yes, it is CAN-SPAM Act compliant.

- If people would like to unsubscribe, they just email me back — and this is a really good chance to dig in!

- That's where it is super important what you say. And the magic phrase is: **"You don't have to reply if you don't want to"**.

Magic! This makes people feel in control, that they are free from expectations to respond.
Did this several times (fortunately few people unsubscribe from [ReadByHumans](https://readbyhumans.com)) — works every time!

Try this out and let me know if this works for you!
